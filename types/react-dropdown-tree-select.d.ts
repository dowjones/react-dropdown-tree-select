         * A multi selectable dropdown which supports tree data with parent-child relationships. This is the default mode.
         *
         * - hierarchical
         * A multi selectable dropdown which supports tree data **without** parent-child relationships. In this mode, selecting a node has no ripple effects on its descendants or ancestors. Subsequently, `showPartiallySelected` becomes a moot flag and has no effect as well.

         *
         * - simpleSelect
         * Turns the dropdown into a simple, single select dropdown. If you pass tree data, only immediate children are picked, grandchildren nodes are ignored.
         *
         * ⚠️ If multiple nodes in data are selected - by setting either `checked` or `isDefaultValue`, only the first visited node stays selected.
         *
         * - radioSelect
         * Turns the dropdown into radio select dropdown.

         * Like `simpleSelect`, you can only select one value; but keeps the tree/children structure.
         *
         * ⚠️ If multiple nodes in data are selected - by setting either `checked` or `isDefaultValue`, only the first visited node stays selected.
